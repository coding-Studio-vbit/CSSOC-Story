It was a boring sunday.Alan decided to go out to get some fresh air 
then all of a sudden he gets a phone call from an unknown number...
Alan decided to lift up the call. "Hello?". He heard no response."Hello?....Hello?".
Then all of a sudden he heard strange noises, it sounded like an interrogation. "Tell me where it is, or else...",
"Please- please dont kill me....i dont know, i honestly dont know....i got a family...plea-".
the suddenly Alan heard two gunshots and an intense yell from the guy. They must have butt-dialed him somehow,
but now Alan was a witness to something he wouldnt have guessed would happen. 
The call was still going on...he heard a man, "MAKE him talk". He understood the man who was shot was still alive.
He immediately went home and continued to listen to the call.
He heard a car pull up and the man getting into the car.
Two men were talking, "We need
him to speak....he's the only lead we've got to finding our package".
"Isn't he just a bank clerk??...How are you so sure he knows about it at all?".
"There's security cam footage of him bumping with a guy in a bus station and exchanging similar looking packages".
"He might have exchanged the package by mistake".
"Whatever it is....we need to find out....."
"Which bus station by the way??"
"The one at 12th of st. pedral, 2 min from our drop point"
Alan immediately got up from his chair and started to look at a map.
He circled the 12th of st. pedral and started calculating and circling places 2 min away from the bus station.
"Dude, what are u doing?"asked Alan's roommate."Get out and leave me alone"replied Alan.
"I'm about to crack a case..."He murmured to himself....
After circling a dozen different points on the map, he thought,"I better tell the cops".
He pulled out his phone and logged in to the TS police anonymous tipping portal.
He uploaded the recorded call.But Alan still wasn't satisfied.
He wanted to follow the trail himself. He called his best pal Kunal.
"Yo, I'm on a trail, want some adventure?", Alan exclaimed.
"Another case! Tell me about it!",said kunal excited.
"Meet me at Bobby's coffee in 2 minutes, Ill brief you there."
Kunal showed up at the rendezvous point. Bobby's coffee was right across the
bus station. "We'll keep an eye out for anybody suspicious.",Alan instructed kunal.
"Shouldn't we call the police?", asked Kunal.
