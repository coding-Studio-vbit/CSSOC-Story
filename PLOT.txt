It was a boring sunday.Alan decided to go out to get some fresh air 
then all of a sudden he gets a phone call from an unknown number...
Alan decided to lift up the call. "Hello?". He heard no response. "Hello?....Hello?".
Then all of a sudden he heard strange noises, it sounded like an interrogation. "Tell me where it is, or else...",
"Please- please dont kill me....i dont know, i honestly dont know....i got a family...plea-".
the suddenly Alan heard two gunshots and an intense yell from the guy. They must have butt-dialed him somehow,
but now Alan was a witness to something he wouldnt have guessed would happen. Alan stood there still horrified by phone call.He felt his blood rushing through his head, his ears
warming up, his heart pounding. A torrent of thoughts stormed his head. He felt that the voice was familiar.
Then suddenly it hit him like a ten pound block at the back of his skull.The voice was of Kunal, his brother.
