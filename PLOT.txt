It was a boring sunday.Alan decided to go out to get some fresh air 
then all of a sudden he gets a phone call from an unknown number...
Alan decided to lift up the call. "Hello?". He heard no response. "Hello?....Hello?".
Then all of a sudden he heard strange noises, it sounded like an interrogation. "Tell me where it is, or else...",
"Please- please dont kill me....i dont know, i honestly dont know....i got a family...plea-".
the suddenly Alan heard two gunshots and an intense yell from the guy. They must have butt-dialed him somehow,
but now Alan was a witness to something he wouldnt have guessed would happen. 
The call was still going on...he heard a man, "MAKE him talk". He understood the man who was shot was still alive.
He immediately went home and continued to listen to the call.
He heard a car pull up and the man getting into the car.
Two men were talking, "We need
him to speak....he's the only lead we've got to finding our package".
"Isn't he just a bank clerk??...How are you so sure he knows about it at all?".
"There's security cam footage of him bumping with a guy in a bus station and exchanging similar looking packages".
"He might have exchanged the package by mistake".
"Whatever it is....we need to find out....".
"Which bus station by the way??"
"The one at 12th of st. pedral, 2 min from our drop point"
Alan immediately got up from his chair and started to look at a map.
He circled the 12th of st. pedral and started calculating and circling places 2 min away from the bus station.
"Dude, what are u doing?"asked Alan's roommate."Get out and leave me alone"replied Alan.
"I'm about to crack a case..."He murmured to himself....   
He immediatley then ended the phone call because it no longer felt safe to be listening.
"okay Eric, I think i found something,There's an old monument that people haven't been visiting since years and that's the only place anyone could try attempt a murder!" Alan said to his roommate.
"How fast can you get us there?" He added.
"um..15? It's not really close" Eric replied in confusion.
"Let's go, Eric!". Alan and Eric ran out the house and drove away.
They reached the monument but,there were no signs of people there. It was a cold breezy night and the sound of dry leaves beneath thier feet was all that was heard. They kept moving forward.
"Alan.....look there..." Eric said. There was a man tied to a chair.
Alan ran towards him. "Sir... are okay? sir....!" .
"I think he's de.a.d.." Eric stammered.
Alan was worried and sad that he couldn't save the man in time. 
Eric immediatly started checking through the man's pockets.
"Alan, I think we got something here." Holding a small book and phone in his hand.
Alan grabbed them and went through them. The book had writtings that weren't understandable and every call in his phone were from different numbers.
"I think it's coded..."Eric said.
Alan was so confused and he was filled with questions. If this man was just a bank clerk why would he have writtings coded in a book?
How is he related to that package? Who did he give it to? What was in that package ? Why was he ready to die instead of telling the truth?
How are they connected? Did I come all the way to save the wrong man?
"Alan!! This isn't safe anymore we have to go do you understand me?" Eric said.
Just when they were about the leave... "Turn around now!" A female's voice was heard...
As they slowly turned around, they found themselves at gunpoint."You've come at a very wrong time, Alan", she snarled."Who are you?How do you know my name?"
"All in good time, let's go now!"she ordered instinctively pointing the gun and guiding us towards the exit. As they made their way towards the car, endless questions swarmed through Alan's mind.'Was all of this planned?', 'Was he the rightful recipient to that phone call?','Is he walking into a death trap?'. A blue honda civic surrounded by two tall daunting men didn't help ease his mind. Eric had the same fazed look in his eyes, for a brief moment they made eye contact, Alan tried giving him a reassuring look, everything will be okay he wanted to say, but he wasn't certain either.
Mustering all his courage he asked, "Who are you? Where are you taking us?", a quick blow to his head left him cold, his vision blurred and quickly shrouded by darkness.

Then, Alan woke up to realize all this was just a dream and the blow on his head was his mother's slipper since Alan was late to college.
